			<h1>About The Artist</h1>
			<p>Hi. My name is <a href="http://nuclearpixel.com/">Admiral Potato</a>. I'm extremely passionate about my craft; I am both a Web Developer and a Motion Graphic Artist, and I care enough about the quality of my visual arts that I wrote this experience to represent those visuals with quality and integrity online. <a href="http://admiralpotato.tumblr.com/faq" target="_blank">Here's a place where I've written some words about myself.</a></p>

			<h2>About the custom Video Player</h2>
			<p>The <a href="https://github.com/AdmiralPotato/vue-perfectlooper" target="_blank">vue-perfectlooper</a> is a perfectly looping image sequence player with fullscreen capabilities, built with mobile performance and keyboard accessibility in mind. This is a tool that I wrote for animated loop artists to use freely. All it needs is for the <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a> to library be loaded, and to be given the addresses of the frames to play back. It is an MIT licensed open source package available on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-perfectlooper" target="_blank">NPM</a> and <a href="https://unpkg.com/vue-perfectlooper" target="_blank">Unpkg</a>. It was designed to meet the use cases of both Vue SSR rendering, as well as in the non-compiled browser environment. Please get in touch with me if you would like help setting this up to share your art!</p>
