			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hi. My name is <a href="http://nuclearpixel.com/">Admiral Potato</a>. Welcome to my perfectly-looping Video Portfolio. I put a lot of work into making online experience looks as good as it does, so let's make it sound impressive with some buzzwords. This is a first-of-its-kind Marble Friendly Intersite Webbernet Wapp with Lazor Synthesized Virtual Shadow Dog Crumpitulation.</p>
			<p>I made this because I wanted a place to post my perfectly looping animations in a fullscreen format with a minimum of visually offensive compression artifacts - and most importantly, I wanted my animations to loop perfectly. No existing video hosting service met my standards.</p>
