That's pretty much what I can say about this design. It can often come from the very place that you intend to put your designs as well.

In this circumstance, I found someone who has excellent taste in industrial design, and I was inspired by a LOT of what they have been reblogging. In an attempt to overcome my recent low of creative energy, I thought I would reach out to them and see if they would be interested in watching my process as I create something new.

I used to mentor at a local community center for about 11 years - but it closed down last year because of political idiocy.

It was great for me, because it turns out that I have really missed teachingâ€¦ so thank you, friend. :)<p>If you happen to be a fan of my work, have similar aesthetic tastes, and are interested in seeing how I create my designs, give me a poke.
